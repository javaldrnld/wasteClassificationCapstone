# Single Use Plastic Classification

This capstone project aims to develop a system for single use plastic detection and classification using deep learning techniques. The project is divided into two main stages:

- **Object Detection**: Identify and locate waste objects in images using MobileNetV2 SSD.
- **Image Classification**: Classify the detected objects into two categories such as "waste" and "not waste" using MobileNetV2.
